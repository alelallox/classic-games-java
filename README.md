in this repository there are 5 games programmed in java. All the games have been programmed based on two-dimensional arrays.
game rules:
-forza quattro:
Players alternate in placing their marks signs on the grid. The marks are inserted into the desired column and fall to the lowest position available. The game ends when one of the players manages to place four of their marks in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal line.
-Master Mind whit wards:
In the original mastermind you have to guess a sequence of colors, instead in this version the goal is to guess a word. The user inserts a word or a sequence of letters and if a letter is correct but is not in the right position, it will be colored yellow. But if the letter is correct and is in the right position, it will be colored green. Incorrect letters remain normal and you have a maximum of 6 attempts.
-prato fiorito: 
Some boxes contain mines, while others are safe. The goal is to find out all the safe boxes without digging any mines. empty cells contain the number of mines in the 8 boxes around. The game ends when all the safe boxes have been discovered or when you click on a mine, causing the loss of the game.
-tris:
tris is played on a 3x3 grid where one player is X and the other is O. The goal of the game is to align three of its symbols horizontally, vertically or diagonally. 
-2048:
in game 2048 you have a 4x4 grid and the aim is to combine the numeric tiles on the grid to reach the value of 2048. At each turn, you can move all the tiles in the grid in one of four directions: up, down, left or right. If two tiles of the same value collide during a move, they join to form a tile with twice the value.
